        // Output
        //You learned from the previous chapter that you can use the println() method to output values or print text in Java:
        System.out.println("Hello World!");

        // You can add as many println() methods as you want. Note that it will add a new line for each method:
        System.out.println("Hello World!");
        System.out.println("I am learning Java.");
        System.out.println("It is awesome!");

        // You can also output numbers, and perform mathematical calculations:
        System.out.println(3 + 3);

        // The Print() Method
        //There is also a print() method, which is similar to println().
        //The only difference is that it does not insert a new line at the end of the output:
        System.out.print("Hello World! ");
        System.out.print("I will print on the same line.");

        // Note that we add an extra space (after "Hello World!" in the example above), for better readability.

        //In this tutorial, we will only use println() as it makes it easier to read the output of code.
