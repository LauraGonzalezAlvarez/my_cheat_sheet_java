        // Java Booleans
        // Very often, in programming, you will need a data type that can only have one of two values, like:
        // YES / NO
        // ON / OFF
        // TRUE / FALSE
        // For this, Java has a boolean data type, which can take the values true or false.

        // Boolean Values
        //A boolean type is declared with the boolean keyword and can only take the values true or false:
        boolean isJavaFun = true;
        boolean isFishTasty = false;
        System.out.println(isJavaFun);     // Outputs true
        System.out.println(isFishTasty);   // Outputs false

        // However, it is more common to return boolean values from boolean expressions, for conditional testing (see below).

        // Boolean Expression
        //A Boolean expression is a Java expression that returns a Boolean value: true or false.

        //You can use a comparison operator, such as the greater than (>) operator to find out if an expression (or a variable) is true:
        int x = 10;
        int y = 9;
        System.out.println(x > y); // returns true, because 10 is higher than 9

        // Or even easier:
        System.out.println(10 > 9); // returns true, because 10 is higher than 9

        // In the examples below, we use the equal to (==) operator to evaluate an expression:
        System.out.println(x == 10); // returns true, because the value of x is equal to 10

        System.out.println(10 == 15); // returns false, because 10 is not equal to 15

        // The Boolean value of an expression is the basis for all Java comparisons and conditions.

        //You will learn more about conditions in the next chapter.
