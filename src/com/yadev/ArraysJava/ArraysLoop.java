        Loop Through an Array

        Loop Through an Array with For-Each

        */

        The example above can be read like this: for each String element (called i - as in index) in cars, print out the value of i.

        If you compare the for loop and for-each loop, you will see that the for-each method is easier to write,
        it does not require a counter (using the length property), and it is more readable.
